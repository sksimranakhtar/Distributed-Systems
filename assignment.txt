Use thread program to simulate distributed environment to find the sum of
all the elements of a large array of integers.
Step I: Create an array of 100 numbers and populate them randomly so that
the array may contain duplicate entries also.
Step II: Create multiple threads to find the sum of all the elements in the
array. All the threads should work concurrently to find the sum, so use
locking mechanism in the critical section.
Step III: After initial checking increase the array size in steps to
accommodate 1 billion integers and increase number of threads accordingly
and start measuring the speed-up.
Step IV : Finally represent all the speed-up results in tabular manner
mentioning the array size and no. of threads used.

Leader selection Algorithm


Assignment 3
Write a program which goes on taking integers as input. Write another program
which prints the integers as soon as they are read by the first program. Both the
programs run in an infinite loop. The programs should communicate using shared
memory. Create the shared memory using mmap. Access the shared memory using
open.
